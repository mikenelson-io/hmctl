# Pure Fusion CLI

`hmctl` is the command-line interface for [Pure Fusion](https://www.purestorage.com/enable/pure-fusion.html).

You can find a description of the [available commands](./docs/hmctl.md) in this repository.

## Installation

### Linux

You must first grant execution permissions to the binary with `chmod u+x <file_name>`, then simply execute it from your command line.  For extra convenience, you can add this file to your `$PATH`.

### MacOS

For MacOS, you simply have to right-click the file and select "Open".  Your system will warn you that the file cannot be opened because it is from an _unidentified developer_.  That is fine.  You have to go to _System Preferences_ -> _Security & Privacy_ -> _General_ and then click to "Open Anyway".

### Windows

You have to rename the binary to add the `.exe` extension.  Then you can open it in your terminal as usual.
